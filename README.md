# BASE CODE FOR RESEARCH ON SIMULATED ANNEALING COOLING SCHEDULES AND CONSTRUCTAL DESIGN

Here are the script files and results of geometric optimization of Y-shaped cavity embedded into a conducting wall with heat generation.
The aim for this research is the maximization of thermal performance of solid domain by means of cavity geometry. 
In this optimization was employed the Constructal Design and Simulated Annealing for the seek of best geometries of Y-shaped cavity.
